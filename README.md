# Disciple Tools - Dashboard

This plugin adds a beautiful start page to assist disciple makers in knowing what are the most important actions to take (New Contacts, Contacts Needing Update, etc).

## Purpose

In an access ministry, where you have a large amount of incoming contacts that need follow-up
this starting dashboard helps to clarify from the moment that the disciple make signs in to address
the most urgent issues.

It quickly helps you answer:
1. Do I have any new contacts assigned to me?
2. Do I have any contacts that need follow-up?
3. What tasks do I have outstanding?
4. How is my pace and progress?

## Usage
#### Will Do

- Quick access to number of contacts, newly assigned contacts, and contacts needing updates.
- Quick access to availability for more contact assignments
- Quick access to tasks.
- Quick access to key metrics for faith milestones, personal benchmarks, and seeker progress.

#### Will Not Do

- Does not do direct editing. It only surfaces the key items for focus.

## Requirements

- Disciple Tools Theme installed on a Wordpress Server

## Installing

- Install as a standard Disciple.Tools/Wordpress plugin in the system Admin/Plugins area.
- Requires the user role of Administrator.
